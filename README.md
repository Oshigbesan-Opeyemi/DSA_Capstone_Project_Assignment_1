# Kultra Mega Stores Inventory 
## Sales and Order Anaylsis
This analysis explores the sales and order transactions of the customers of KMS Inventory which is headquartered in Lagos and specialises in the sales of office supplies and furniture.

## Project Overview
 This project showcases a range of SQL skills used to analyze the overall performance and profitability of KMS Inventory over a three year period (2009 - 2012) in regards to sales and orders whilst providing valuable observations and practical recommendations to the management.

 ### Project Objectives
 The main aim of this analysis is to aid the management of KMS Inventory to make data driven decisions which they need to improve their order deliveries, customer profitability and maximise profit.

 ### Data Sources
 The data set [KMS Case Study] and [Order Status] files used for analysis in this project are csv files shared with us via our learning platform.

 ### Tools Used
 I made use of Microsoft SQL server for this analysis.

 ### Data Cleaning And Preparation
All transformation took palce in the SQL query page. Although the data was well structured, I still had to alter columns containing values to change the data type and drop other irrelevant columns after the project was conducted.

 ### Projects
  * In querying this data, I executed tasks like: 
  * Database creation for KMS Inventory Orders with the create command
  * Data importation (csv file) into SQL studio
  * Data transformation into an analysis ready dataset using commands like alter set and drop
  * Exploratory Data Analysis: data aggregation, manipulation and analysis with commands like sum, count, rank asc, desc etc

 ## Data Analysis Report
The analysis generally required me to solve two major Case Scenarios

### Case I
#### Sales / Revenue: In this case scenario, I reviewed all matters relating to sales like;
 * Products with the highets sales
 * Top 3 and Bottom 3 regions in terms of sales
 * Bottom 10 customers in terms of sales and
 * And shipping costs in relation to ship mode

### Case II 
#### Customer Profitability and Order Priority: In this case scenario, I answered all questions relating to profits, revenue and order priority like:
 * Who are the most valuable customers? and what products they pruchased
 * Which customer placed the most order and their segment
 * Who are the most profitable customers?
 * Which customer returned items?
 * And the the question of basing shipping cost on order priority

## Observations
While analyszing this dataset, I gathered the following valuable insights
 * The bottom customers in terms of sales recorded the lowest sales because their order quantity were low and they mostly purchased low cost products
 * The ship mode (delivery truck) was the most expensive, drove up the shipping cost thereby reducing profits and yet was the slowest ship mode
 * The ship mode (express air) was most widely used by customers irrespective of their order priority
 * Quite a number of customers returned items without explanations

## Recommendations: 
KMS management should:
 * Give discounts in relation to order quantity to ensure that low order customers won't reduce profits
 * Collect feedback from customers to understand their needs and discourage returns
 * Review pricing and implement loyalty rewards to customers drive sales
 * Offer complementary products to bottom customers in terms of sales based on their order pattern
 * Review orders such that ship modes are based on order priority which should determine the shipping cost hereby delivering orders more efficiently whilst reducing shipping cost
